# Get started with SAP AI Core & SAP AI Launchpad

## SAP AI Core

SAP AI Core is part of the services portfolio that SAP BTP provides. It is used to
train a machine learning model and to deploy the model in the form of a service running
in the cloud on SAP BTP. Clients can then send data to the service endpoint and will receive the model's
prediction based on that data as a response. Both model training and serving happen in a scalable and for the most part hyperscaler-agnostic way.

SAP AI Core will play an important role during this mission. Therefore, before proceeding
with the mission, it is recommended to first get a basic understanding of SAP AI Core.

Skim through the [SAP AI Core
documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_CORE/2d6c5984063c40a59eda62f4a9135bee/d029a32c22fb45fbb607e6a2c48c8a0e.html)
to get a first overview of what it is all about. As a next step, you might want to go through a [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/group.ai-core-get-started-basics.html) that showcases how to use it. In this tutorial follow the track that uses the [SAP AI Core Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ai-core-sdk/) in order to interact with SAP AI Core programmatically in plain python.

## SAP AI Launchpad

SAP AI Launchpad is an application in SAP BTP. With it, one can overview one's own AI use case having the convenience of a user interface in the browser. It showcases artifacts that are relevant to your use case like the dataset used for training and the trained model. Further one can observe the training and serving process and the underlying configurations that are used for them.

Skim through the [SAP AI Launchpad documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/AI_LAUNCHPAD/92d77f26188e4582897b9106b9cb72e0/760889ab809841c8a8905ca492f902cb.html?version=CLOUD) to get a first overview of SAP AI Launchpad.
