# Get started with Azure OpenAI Service

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
