# React Native

React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create native mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms, using a single codebase, which results in faster development times and lower costs. In addition to supporting JavaScript, React Native also provides support for TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that enables developers to write more scalable and maintainable code by catching errors early in the development process.

In addition to React Native, there are various tools and services available that can enhance and simplify the process of building mobile applications using this framework. One such tool is Expo, a comprehensive set of tools and services built around React Native. Expo aims to streamline the development process by providing an integrated development environment and access to pre-built components and libraries. Expo supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, and includes features like live reloading, push notifications, and over-the-air updates, which can make the app development process faster and more efficient. By using Expo, developers can have a more seamless experience building React Native apps and gain access to many useful features and libraries.
