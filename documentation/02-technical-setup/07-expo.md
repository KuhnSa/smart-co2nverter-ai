# Expo Go Client & Expo Account

If you want to publish the React Native app and make it available to other users, you will need to [create an Expo account](https://expo.dev/signup) and use the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/). This is because Expo provides a platform for hosting and distributing the app, as well as offering tools for building, testing and deploying the project.

However, if you only want to run the React Native app locally on your own device, creating an account for Expo is not necessary. You can still use the Expo CLI to serve it locally and test it on your device or emulator without the need for an Expo account.

To open the app, you will need to install the [Expo Go client](https://expo.dev/client) on your device, which can be found on the App Store or Google Play.
