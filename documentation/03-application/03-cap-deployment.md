# Deploy CAP API to Cloud Foundry

1. Via the [Clound Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) login to your Cloud Foundry space to which you want to deploy the CAP API
2. Change to the respective directory of the CAP API sample (`/api`) and deploy the API through:

```shell
$ npm run deploy # using NPM
$ yarn deploy # using yarn
```

TODO

- Describe that in the next step, we will leverage the existing tutorial and therefore the naming of services could be different.
